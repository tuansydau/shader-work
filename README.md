# shader-work
> A collection of GLSL shaders that I've written since December 6th, 2023.

I have always wanted to do game development visuals but would likely get decimated in the industry. I'll self-study graphics development until I'm sure I'll survive.

Below are the shaders that I have worked on, in GLSL. You can get them in higher resolution by rendering the respective files yourself in a [ShaderToy environment](https://www.shadertoy.com/new).
